00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:06,782
was

4
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:07,083
an

5
00:00:07,323 --> 00:00:07,803
incredible

00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:08,443
scientist.

7
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:08,743
He

8
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:09,043
spent

9
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:09,283
most

10
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:09,343
of

00:00:09,403 --> 00:00:09,483
his

12
00:00:09,523 --> 00:00:09,743
time

00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:09,823
at

00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:10,544
Caltech.

15
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:11,244
The

16
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:11,504
idea

17
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:11,584
of

20
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:12,684
were

21
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:12,824
all

22
00:00:12,844 --> 00:00:12,984
these

23
00:00:13,084 --> 00:00:13,585
particles

24
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:13,765
or

25
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:14,345
interacting

26
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:14,485
in

27
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:14,985
mysterious

28
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:15,305
ways.

29
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:15,845
He

30
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:16,105
came

31
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:16,245
up

32
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:16,445
with

33
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:16,625
a

34
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:16,906
thing

35
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:17,126
called

36
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:17,546
Feynman

37
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:18,206

38
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:18,486
that

39
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:18,666
he

40
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:18,826
wanted

well-priced

44
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:19,946
for.

45
00:00:20,507 --> 00:00:20,827
Perhaps

46
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:21,087
even

47
00:00:21,127 --> 00:00:21,247
more

48
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:21,687
importantly,

49
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:21,767
he

50
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:21,907
was

51
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:22,007
an

52
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:22,487
amazing

53
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:22,987
teacher.

54
00:00:23,387 --> 00:00:23,507
He

55
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:23,768
did

56
00:00:23,928 --> 00:00:24,028
a

57
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:24,568
series

58
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:24,668
of

59
00:00:24,748 --> 00:00:25,208
lectures,

60
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:25,988
which

61
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:26,188
were

62
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:26,368
for

63
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:26,768
people

64
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:26,928
who

65
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:27,329
didn't

66
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,349
specialize

67
00:00:28,409 --> 00:00:28,489
in

68
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:28,949
physics.

69
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:29,449
It's

70
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:30,089
such

71
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:30,169
a

72
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:30,450
great

73
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,030
example

74
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:31,130
of

75
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,370
how

76
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:31,530
he

77
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:31,730
could

78
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,250
explain

79
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:32,670
things.

80
00:00:33,371 --> 00:00:33,471
in

81
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:33,531
a

82
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:34,171
fun

83
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:34,291
and

84
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:34,871
interesting

85
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:35,351
way

86
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:35,851

87
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:36,572
anyone.

88
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:37,472
And

89
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:37,872
he's

90
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:38,292
very

91
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:38,852
funny.

92
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:39,852
It's

93
00:00:39,892 --> 00:00:40,012
that

94
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:40,212

problem

102
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:43,233
of

103
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:43,453
what

104
00:00:43,513 --> 00:00:43,853
drove

105
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:43,933
the

106
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:44,293

by

118
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:48,914

that

120
00:00:49,094 --> 00:00:49,194
there

121
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:49,334

As

136
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:56,375
we'll

137
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:56,555
see

something,

he

this

Do

191
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:16,765
I

192
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,206
understand

193
00:01:17,306 --> 00:01:17,566
why

194
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:18,326
we

195
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:18,526
don't

196
00:01:18,586 --> 00:01:18,747

Do

this?

206
00:01:21,388 --> 00:01:21,508
And

207
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:22,489
because

you

223
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:28,212
through

00:01:28,252 --> 00:01:28,332
the

225
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:28,792
path

226
00:01:28,892 --> 00:01:28,952

00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:29,733
different

229
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:30,693
possibilities,

your

234
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:33,195
abilities.

235
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,015
incredible.

instance

239
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:33,975
in

00:01:34,015 --> 00:01:34,115
the

air

242
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:34,636
would

243
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:34,856
like

244
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:34,956
to

245
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:35,096
be

246
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:35,356
next

247
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:35,436
to

carbon

249
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:36,036
and

250
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:36,116
if

251
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:36,296
they

252
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:36,436
get

253
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:36,536
a

00:01:36,576 --> 00:01:36,876
nearage

255
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:36,956
on

256
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:37,056
it

257
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:37,236
they

258
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:37,556
snap

259
00:01:37,596 --> 00:01:37,976
together.

260
00:01:38,717 --> 00:01:38,777
If

261
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:38,897
you

262
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:39,037
can

263
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:39,197
get

264
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:39,297
it

265
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:39,997
faster

266
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:40,617
by

267
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:40,937
heating

268
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:41,037
it

269
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:41,157
up

270
00:01:41,237 --> 00:01:41,617
somehow

271
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:42,097
somewhere

272
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:42,237
they

273
00:01:42,277 --> 00:01:42,397
come

274
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:42,678
close

275
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:42,878
enough

276
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:42,998
for

277
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:43,078
the

278
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:43,438
carbon

279
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:43,598
and

280
00:01:43,718 --> 00:01:44,038
snap

281
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:44,238
in

282
00:01:45,098 --> 00:01:45,158
and

283
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:45,278
that

284
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:45,478
gives

285
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:45,538
a

286
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:45,738
lot

287
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:45,818
of

288
00:01:45,858 --> 00:01:46,158
jiggly

289
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:46,579
motion

290
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:47,319
which

291
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:47,539
might

292
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:47,719
hit

293
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:47,899
some

294
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,119
other

295
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:48,519
atoms

296
00:01:48,539 --> 00:01:48,819
making

297
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,079
those

298
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:49,299
go

299
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:49,719
faster

300
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:49,839
so

301
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:49,999
they

302
00:01:50,019 --> 00:01:50,139
can

303
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:50,459
climb

304
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:50,599
up

305
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:50,740
and

306
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,020
bump

307
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,320
against

308
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:51,580
other

309
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:52,780
carbon

310
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,100
atoms

311
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,540
and

312
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:53,740
they

313
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,080
jiggle

314
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,300
and

315
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,400
then

316
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,580
make

317
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:54,921
mother's

318
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,221
jiggle

319
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:55,321
and

320
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:55,441
you

321
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:55,561
get

322
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:55,601
a

323
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:56,001
terrible

324
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,761
catastrophe.

325
00:01:57,662 --> 00:01:57,843
That

326
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:58,443
catastrophe

327
00:01:58,463 --> 00:01:58,564
is

328
00:01:58,604 --> 00:01:58,644
a

329
00:01:58,724 --> 00:01:59,104
fire.

330
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:00,025
It's

331
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:00,526
taking

332
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:01,167
something

333
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:02,348
that

334
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:02,789
is

335
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:02,869
a

336
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:03,149
little

337
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:03,730
mysterious

338
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:03,870
to

339
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,150
most

340
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:04,611
people

341
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:04,951
and

342
00:02:05,072 --> 00:02:05,532
using

343
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:05,933
very

344
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:06,313
simple

345
00:02:06,373 --> 00:02:07,194
concepts

346
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:07,715
to

347
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:08,456
explain

348
00:02:08,516 --> 00:02:08,656
how

349
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:08,716
it

350
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:09,096
works.

351
00:02:09,157 --> 00:02:09,237
He

352
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:09,457
doesn't

353
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:09,677
even

354
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:09,958
tell

355
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:10,078
you

356
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:10,198
he's

357
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:10,498
talking

358
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:10,698
about

359
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,039
fire

360
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:11,259
until

361
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:11,359
the

362
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:11,700
very

363
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:11,940
end

364
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,240
and

365
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,381
you

366
00:02:12,401 --> 00:02:12,561
feel

367
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:12,741
like

368
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:12,961
you're

369
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:13,141
kind

370
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:13,222
of

371
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:13,622
figuring

372
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:13,702
it

373
00:02:13,782 --> 00:02:13,882
out

374
00:02:13,942 --> 00:02:14,303
together

375
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:14,503
with

376
00:02:14,543 --> 00:02:14,663
him.

377
00:02:16,007 --> 00:02:16,447
Feynman

378
00:02:16,967 --> 00:02:17,327
made

379
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:17,848
science

380
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,068
so

381
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:18,788
fascinating.

382
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:18,989
He

383
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:19,449
reminded

384
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:19,589
us

385
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:19,769
how

386
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:19,989
much

387
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:20,369
fun

388
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:20,489
it

389
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:20,690
is

390
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:20,850
and

391
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,370
everybody

392
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:21,670
can

393
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:22,371
have

394
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:22,411
a

395
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:22,791
pretty

396
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,091
full

397
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:23,791
understanding.

398
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:23,852
So

399
00:02:24,032 --> 00:02:24,212
it's

400
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:24,512
such

401
00:02:24,532 --> 00:02:24,552
a

402
00:02:24,652 --> 00:02:25,232
joyful

403
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,393
example

404
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:26,593
of

405
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:27,234
how

406
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:27,434
we'd

407
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:27,634
all

408
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:27,894
like

409
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:28,114
to

410
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:28,935
learn

411
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:29,055
and

412
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:29,255
think

413
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:29,515
about

414
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:29,775
things.
