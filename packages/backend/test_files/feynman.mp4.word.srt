very

92
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:38,767
funny.

93
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:39,841
It's

As

168
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,001
Yeah.

this

00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:16,640
Do

195
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:16,761
I

00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:17,202
understand

197
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:17,564
why

198
00:01:18,226 --> 00:01:18,327
we

199
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:18,528
don't

it

this?

210
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,501
And

211
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:22,485
because

such

219
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:24,343
a

220
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:24,584
deep

221
00:01:24,644 --> 00:01:25,328
understanding,

222
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:26,703
His

223
00:01:26,763 --> 00:01:27,245
ability

224
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:27,385
to

225
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:27,646
take

226
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:27,927
you

227
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:28,207
through

228
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:28,328
the

229
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:28,769
path

230
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:28,950
of

231
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,371
the

232
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:29,732
different

233
00:01:29,772 --> 00:01:30,654
possibilities

234
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:31,362
was

235
00:01:31,422 --> 00:01:32,024
incredible.

236
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:33,368
Oxygen,

237
00:01:33,388 --> 00:01:33,568
for

238
00:01:33,589 --> 00:01:33,849
instance,

239
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:33,970
in

240
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,130
the

241
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,451
air,

242
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:34,652
would

243
00:01:34,692 --> 00:01:34,852
like

244
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:34,952
to

245
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:35,113
be

246
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:35,354
next

247
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:35,454
to

248
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:35,875
carbon

249
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,021
and

250
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:36,122
if

251
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:36,302
they're

252
00:01:36,322 --> 00:01:36,543
getting

253
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:36,724
near

254
00:01:36,744 --> 00:01:36,864
each

00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:37,045
other,

256
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:37,245
they

257
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:37,567
snap

258
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:37,988
together.

259
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:38,791
If

260
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:38,891
you

261
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:39,052
can

262
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,212
get

263
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:39,292
it

264
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:39,975
faster

265
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:40,603
by

266
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:40,944
heating

267
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:41,024
it

268
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:41,164
up

269
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:41,626
somehow,

270
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,087
somewhere,

271
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:42,248
they

272
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:42,408
come

273
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:42,689
close

274
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:42,869
enough

275
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:43,010
for

276
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,090
the

277
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:43,431
carbon

278
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:43,591
and

279
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:44,053
snap

280
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:44,193
in.

281
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:45,162
And

282
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:45,282
that

283
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:45,483
gives

284
00:01:45,503 --> 00:01:45,543
a

285
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:45,723
lot

286
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:45,803
of

287
00:01:45,864 --> 00:01:46,164
jiggly

288
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:46,586
motion,

289
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:47,308
which

290
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:47,548
might

291
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:47,749
hit

292
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:47,909
some

293
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,130
other

294
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,471
atoms,

295
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:48,692
make

296
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:48,832
them

297
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:49,093
those

298
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:49,293
go

299
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:49,695
faster

300
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:49,841
so

301
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:49,981
they

302
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,142
can

303
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:50,463
climb

304
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:50,603
up

305
00:01:50,664 --> 00:01:50,744
and

306
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:51,025
bump

307
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:51,326
against

308
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:51,587
other

309
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:52,791
carbon

310
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:53,092
atoms,

311
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:53,553
and

312
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:53,754
they

313
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,035
jiggle

314
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:54,062
jiggle

315
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:54,282
and

316
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:54,383
then

317
00:01:54,443 --> 00:01:54,563
make

318
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:54,904
mother's

319
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:55,225
jiggle

320
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:55,326
and

321
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:55,446
you

322
00:01:55,466 --> 00:01:55,566
get

323
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:55,607
a

324
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:55,988
terrible

325
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:56,770
catastrophe.

326
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:57,820
That

327
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,443
catastrophe

328
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:58,564
is

329
00:01:58,604 --> 00:01:58,624
a

330
00:01:58,725 --> 00:01:59,046
fire.

331
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,160
It's

332
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,521
taking

333
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:01,163
something

334
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:02,346
that

335
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:02,807
is

336
00:02:02,847 --> 00:02:02,867
a

337
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:03,148
little

338
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:03,730
mysterious

339
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:03,870
to

340
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,151
most

341
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:04,592
people

342
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:04,953
and

343
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:05,233
you've

344
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:05,534
seen

345
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:05,895
very

346
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:06,302
simple

347
00:02:06,362 --> 00:02:07,185
concepts

348
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:07,707
to

349
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:08,450
explain

350
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,651
how

351
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:08,711
it

352
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:09,072
works.

353
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,240
He

354
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:09,421
doesn't

355
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:09,682
even

356
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:09,943
tell

357
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,043
you

358
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:10,204
he's

359
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:10,485
talking

360
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:10,685
about

361
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:11,027
fire

362
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:11,247
till

363
00:02:11,287 --> 00:02:11,348
the

364
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:11,689
very

365
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:11,930
end

366
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,231
and

367
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:12,371
you

368
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:12,552
feel

369
00:02:12,572 --> 00:02:12,732
like

370
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:12,933
you're

371
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,121
kind

372
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:13,201
of

373
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:13,603
figuring

374
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:13,683
it

375
00:02:13,763 --> 00:02:13,864
out

376
00:02:13,924 --> 00:02:14,285
together

377
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:14,486
with

378
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:14,647
him.

379
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,421
Biman

380
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:17,305
made

381
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:17,888
science

382
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:18,068
so

383
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:18,751
fascinating.

384
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:18,980
He

385
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:19,462
reminded

386
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:19,602
us

387
00:02:19,642 --> 00:02:19,783
how

388
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:19,983
much

389
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:20,365
fun

390
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:20,485
it

391
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:20,685
is

392
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:20,846
and

393
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:21,368
everybody

394
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:21,668
can

395
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,371
have

396
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:22,431
a

397
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:22,792
pretty

398
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:23,093
full

399
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:23,795
understanding

400
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:23,680
So

401
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,201
it's

402
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:24,502
such

403
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:24,562
a

00:02:24,642 --> 00:02:25,224
joyful

405
00:02:25,705 --> 00:02:26,426
example

406
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:26,587
of

407
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:27,248
how

408
00:02:27,288 --> 00:02:27,429
we'd

409
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:27,629
all

410
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:27,890
like

411
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:28,110
to

412
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:28,932
learn

413
00:02:28,972 --> 00:02:29,072
and

414
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:29,273
think

415
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:29,513
about

416
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:29,794
things.
